## **Setup Instructions**

### **Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_db_name
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install Flutter dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. If testing on a physical device, ensure the backend URL in the app matches the server's IP address (e.g., `http://<your-ip>:5000`).
